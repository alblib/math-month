## Problem 3.
### Order of Magnitude
People already found solution until Prime[30], so let's assume the order of magnitude above that. Product[Prime[30]] < 2^155, so if we have to choose 2^n-sized integers, we have to choose bigger than uint256_t. By the way, this integer type can handle maximum Prime[43].
